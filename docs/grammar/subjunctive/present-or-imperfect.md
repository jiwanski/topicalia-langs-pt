## ðŸ§­ Goal (for GitHub Issue)

Understand when to use the **present** versus the **imperfect subjunctive** in subordinate clauses.
Master the link between the main verbâ€™s tense and the subordinate action, recognizing how the choice of tense affects meaning and formality.
Produce natural sentences such as *Espero que venhas amanhÃ£* vs. *Esperei que viesses ontem* without hesitation.

## 1. The Core Distinction

| Subjunctive Tense | Triggered by | Expresses |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Present Subjunctive** | a **present, future, or timeless** main clause | a **simultaneous or future** action seen as uncertain |
| **Imperfect Subjunctive** | a **past or hypothetical** main clause | a **past or unreal** action seen as uncertain |

**In short:**
> Present/future frame â†’ Present subjunctive
> Past/conditional frame â†’ Imperfect subjunctive

## 2. Present Subjunctive â€” Current or Future Time Frame

Used when the main clause is in the **present, future, or imperative** and the subordinate expresses:
- a current state of doubt, desire, or emotion, or
- an action expected to happen in the future.

| Main Clause | Subordinate Clause | Translation |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| *Espero que ele **venha** hoje.* | (present subjunctive) | I hope he comes today. |
| *Ã‰ bom que vocÃª **estude** mais.* | | Itâ€™s good that you study more. |
| *Direi a verdade para que todos **entendam**.* | | I will tell the truth so everyone understands. |
| *FaÃ§a o que **for** necessÃ¡rio.* | | Do whatever is necessary. |

ðŸ§© **Note:** The present subjunctive often refers to a **future** event in Portuguese.

---

## 3. Imperfect Subjunctive â€” Past or Unreal Time Frame

Used when the main verb is in a **past** tense (preterite, imperfect, pluperfect) or **conditional**, and the subordinate action is:
- in the past, or
- hypothetical/unreal.

| Main Clause | Subordinate Clause | Translation |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------|
| *Esperei que ele **viesse** cedo.* | (imperfect subjunctive) | I hoped he would come early. |
| *Era importante que todos **participassem**.* | | It was important that everyone participate. |
| *Pedi que ela **abrisse** a janela.* | | I asked her to open the window. |
| *Faria isso se ele **estivesse** aqui.* | | I would do it if he were here. |

## 4. Key Pattern: Time Consistency

| Main Verb Tense | Subjunctive Tense | Example |
|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Present | Present | *Ã‰ bom que ele **venha**.* |
| Future | Present | *Direi que ele **venha**.* |
| Imperative | Present | *FaÃ§a que ele **venha**.* |
| Preterite | Imperfect | *Esperei que ele **viesse**.* |
| Imperfect | Imperfect | *Era bom que ele **viesse**.* |
| Conditional | Imperfect | *Faria isso se ele **viesse**.* |

## 5. Common Pitfalls

| Mistake | Why Wrong | Correction |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| *Espero que ele **viesse** amanhÃ£.* | Main verb is present â†’ must use present subjunctive | *Espero que ele **venha** amanhÃ£.* |
| *Esperei que ele **venha** ontem.* | Main verb is past â†’ must use imperfect subjunctive | *Esperei que ele **viesse** ontem.* |
| *Se eu **vim** cedo, te aviso.* | Indicative instead of subjunctive | *Se eu **vier** cedo, te aviso.* |

---

## 6. Expressive Choice and Style

- In **formal writing**, tense agreement (present â†’ present subj., past â†’ imperfect subj.) is strict.
- In **colloquial Portuguese**, speakers sometimes use the indicative instead of the subjunctive, especially after verbs like *achar que* or *ver se*.
  Example: *Acho que ele vem amanhÃ£* instead of *Acho que ele venha amanhÃ£* (the latter sounds too formal).

## 7. Quick Summary

| Situation | Subjunctive Tense | Example |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Main verb in present/future | **Present** | *Espero que ele **venha**.* |
| Main verb in past | **Imperfect** | *Esperei que ele **viesse**.* |
| Hypothetical condition | **Imperfect** | *Se ele **estivesse** aqui, tudo seria melhor.* |
| Universal / timeless truth (sometimes) | **Present** | *Ã‰ possÃ­vel que isso **seja** sempre assim.* |
